# WebDevNotes


// This is my personal notes based on the things that I knew I had to take note of from this course. This is still half-way done as I am still going through the course. I am planning to make a regular update on this repository with the knowledge that I will be able to accumulate as I continue this study.

// Please feel free to modify and add your own notes to make this repository helpful not just for me but for anyone who's interested on this compressed notes based on this course.
