All about HTML:
  - HTML is the foundation of all websites.
  - you cannot create a website with CSS alone nor with JavaScript alone but you can create a website with HTML alone.

HTML Attribute (eg; <hr size="3">)
  - specifies modification to the default element

HTML COMMENT (eg; <!-- this is a comment -->)
  - portions of text which are marked out to be ignored by the browser
  - usually use for putting notes for yourself or other programmers that might look at your code

BOILER PLATE
  - a code template that you can re-use

<meta name="description" content="Free Web Tutorials">
  - the snippet of text that shows when your website is being search
  - search engines crawl the HTML of a website and look for certain meta tags in order to know what your website is about and in order to display them
  in their search index

<i> vs <em> and <b> vs <strong>
  - it's good practice to use <em> tag rather than the <i> tag and the <strong> tag rather than the <b> tag
  - read mdn docs for more information about their differences

<img src="test.png" alt="a test img file">
  - it's best to use an "alt" attribute for SEO purposes

Tips:
  - when you are using the Google Chrome browser, if you want to check the structure of an element from a website, right click your desired element
  and click "inspect" to see the HTML structure that they are built from
  - it's better to separate a <table> into different sections like <thead> for header, <tbody> for body, and <tfoot> for footer so that we can style
  them differently and make them function differently because their section are separated from each other
